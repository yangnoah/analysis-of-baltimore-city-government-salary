An analysis of Baltimore City employee salary data, specifically the police department 

This analysis used data from the [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Government/Baltimore-City-Employee-Salaries-FY2018/biyh-j8tc)

The two questions that this analysis looked at were:
1. What is the impact of job tenure on gross salary for the police department?
2. What is the impact of job tenure and gross salary on the amount of overtime pay in the police department? 

## Analysis Steps for Question 1: 
1. The data was filtered to include only people who have job titles with the word 'Police' 
2. The date of hire data was changed to the accepted Excel date format
3. The tenure for each employee was then calculated and graphed against that employee's gross salary 
4. The equation for the linear regression was then displayed on the graph.
